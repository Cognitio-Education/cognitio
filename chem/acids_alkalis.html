            <p>Most substances are either alkaline, basic or acidic, a quality based on the hydrogen in the substance.</p>
            <h4>The pH Scale</h4>
            <p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=70532491">By Christinelmiller - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0</a></p>
            <img src="/images/chem/pHScale.png" class="intab">
            <p>The pH (potential of hydrogen) scale tells us how acidic or basic/alkaline a substance is. Something with a high concentration of hydrogen ions (<code>H<sup>+</sup></code>) is acidic, while something with a low concentration of hydrogen ions is basic/alkaline. We can use the pH scale to represent these numerically, from 1 being the most acidic to 14 being the most basic/alkaline. In theory the scale goes infinitely in both directions, and you can have a negative pH, but getting substances that are so strongly acidic or basic is difficult and so at GCSE, we only need to know about 1 to 14.</p>
            <p><b>pH IS A LOGARITHMIC SCALE!</b></p>
            <p>This means that for every increase/decrease of 1 pH, there is a x10 increase/decrease of hydrogen concentration.</p>
            <p>So pH 1 is x1000 more concentrated with hydrogen ions than pH 4.</p>
            <p>A substance with a pH of 1 has 0.1 mole/dm<sup>3</sup> (a measurement of concentration) of hydrogen, pH 2 is 0.01 mole/dm<sup>3</sup>, etc.</p>
            <p>Substances with a pH below 7 are acidic, and substances above 7 are basic. The further from 7, the stronger the acid/base. Substances with a pH of 7 are neutral, and are neither acidic nor basic.</p>
            <h4>Bases and Alkalis</h4>
            <p>A base is any substance with a pH of 8 or higher, and is also defined as a substance which <b>accepts hydrogen ions</b>, in a solution.</p>
            <p>An alkali is a <b>soluble base,</b> i.e. it can be dissolved in water.</p>
            <p>Alkalis release hydroxide ions (<code>OH<sup>-</sup></code>) when dissolved.</p>
            <p>The following compounds are ALWAYS bases:</p>
            <div class="quote"><blockquote>
                <ul>
                    <li>metal oxides (metal and oxygen)</li>
                    <li>metal carbonates (metal, carbon and oxygen)</li>
                </ul>
            </blockquote></div>
            <p>Equally, the following compounds are always alkalis, and so are also bases:</p>
            <div class="quote">
                <blockquote>
                    <ul>
                        <li>ammonia (<code>NH<sub>3</sub></code>)</li>
                        <li>metal hydroxides</li>
                    </ul>
                </blockquote>
            </div>
            <h4>Acids</h4>
            <p>Acids are substances with a pH of 6 or lower, and are also defined as a <b>donor of hydrogen ions</b> in a solution.</p>
            <p>Unlike bases, acids never contain metals and instead usually contain hydrogen and sometimes oxygen with other non-metals.</p>
            <p>Acids release hydrogen ions (<code>H<sup>+</sup></code>) when dissolved.</p>
            <p>These acids are absolutely vital, and you need to know their name and formula:</p>
            <div class="quote">
                <blockquote>
                    <ul>
                        <li>sulfuric acid - <code>H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub></code></li>
                        <li>hydrochloric acid - <code>HCl</code></li>
                        <li>nitric acid - <code>HNO<sub>3</sub></code></li>
                    </ul>
                </blockquote>
            </div>
            <p>Another one you'll need to know at GCSE is <b>phosphoric acid</b> (<code>H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub></code>, although it is less important than the three above.</p>
            <h4>Metals and Water</h4>
            <p>We can react metals with water (<code>H<sub>2</sub>O</code>). On our standard reactivity series, this only applies to potassium (<code>K</code>), sodium (<code>Na</code>), and calcium (<code>Ca</code>); the other metals on our series are not reactive enough to react with water directly.</p>
            <p>This reaction forms metal hydroxides, with the following equation:</p>
            <div class="quote"><blockquote><p>metal + water -> metal hydroxide + hydrogen </p></blockquote></div>
            <p>For example, reacting sodium with water gives us sodium hydroxide (<code>NaOH</code>) and hydrogen gas.</p>
            <p>Reactions with water are often quite vigorous, and can sometimes generate enough heat to ignite the hydrogen gas which is produced - potassium, for example, produces a lilac flame when in water.</p>
            <p>If we add universal indicator, it will turn blue. This tells us that the metal hydroxide is alkaline.</p>
            <h4>Neutralisation</h4>
            <p>Acids and alkalis can be reacted together which neutralises them to form a salt. This is called a <b>neutralisation reaction</b> and more information about these reactions can be found <a href="salts_acids.html">here</a>.</p>

                            The same reaction is attempted but with raw copper instead of potassium. A reaction does not take place and copper hydroxide is not produced. Why?

                    An acid has a pH of 1. Another acid has a concentration of hydrogen of 0.0001 mol/dm<sup>3</sup>. What is the pH of this acid?
                    <details>
                        <summary>Show Answer</summary>
                        <p>pH is a logarithmic scale, and so as the pH number increases the concentration is divided by 10. pH 1 = 0.1 mol/dm<sup>3</sup>, and so to get 0.0001 mol/dm<sup>3</sup> you must divide by 10 three times. 1 + 3 = 4, so the pH of the acid is 4.</p>

                    Tim says that iron oxide is soluble in water. Is Tim correct? Explain your answer. <br>
                    <details>
                        <summary>Show Answer</summary>
                        <p>Tim is incorrect. Metal oxides are bases, and so they do not dissolve in water.</p>
