            <h3>Revision Notes</h3>
            <p>When a metal is added to an acid, a reaction <em>usually</em> takes place.</p>
            <p>As a general rule, the equation for this reaction is:</p>
            <blockquote><p>acid + metal -> salt + hydrogen</p></blockquote>
            <p>As we know, a salt is formed when an acid and an alkali are formed, and therefore we can infer that metals are alkaline.</p>
            <h4>Salts from Metals</h4>
            <p>The salt that is formed is dictated by the type of acid that is reacted, and <em>NOT</em> the metal. The three main acids we will look at are hydrochloric acid (<code>HCl</code>), nitric acid (<code>HNO<sub>3</sub></code>), and sulfuric acid (<code>H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub></code>). The resulting salts are as follows:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>metal + hydrochloric acid -> metal chloride + hydrogen</p>
                <p>metal + nitric acid -> metal nitrate + hydrogen</p>
                <p>metal + sulfuric acid -> metal sulfate + hydrogen</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>For example, if we reacted magnesium and hydrochloric acid, we would be left with some magnesium chloride (<code>MgCl</code>), and additionally hydrogen gas. We can check for this hydrogen gas using the lit splint-squeaky pop test.</p>
            <p>However, not all metals can react with acid. If we try to react copper with hydrochloric acid, nothing happens, and the lit splint-squeaky pop test does not work. This is because copper <b>is not reactive enough</b> to react with acids, and this also applies to elements less reactive than copper, such as gold and silver.</p>
            <h4>Metals and Water</h4>
            <p>We can also react metals with water (<code>H<sub>2</sub>O</code>). On our standard reactivity series, this only applies to potassium (<code>K</code>), sodium (<code>Na</code>), and calcium (<code>Ca</code>).</p>
            <p>This reaction forms metal hydroxides, with the following equation:</p>
            <blockquote><p>metal + water -> metal hydroxide + hydrogen </p></blockquote>
            <p>For example, reacting sodium with water gives us sodium hydroxide (<code>NaOH</code>) and hydrogen gas.</p>
            <p>Reactions with water are often quite vigorous, and can sometimes generate enough heat to ignite the hydrogen gas which is produced - potassium, for example, produces a lilac flame when in water.</p>
