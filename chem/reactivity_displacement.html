            <p>Different metals on the periodic table have different reactivities. The reactivity of a metal determines how easily and vigorously it will react with other substances, and we usually look at reactions with acids and water when comparing reactivity.</p>
            <p>We show the most common metals in a <b>reactivity series</b>, from most reactive to least reactive:</p>

            <p><em>Note: carbon is shown on the series because of <b>carbon reduction</b>, which will be mentioned later. It is not a metal.</em></p>
            <h4>Displacement</h4>
            <p>Metals have some unusual reactions. For example, if we react copper oxide with iron:</p>
            <div class="quote"><blockquote><p>copper oxide + iron -> iron oxide + copper</p></blockquote></div>
            <p>The compounds have swapped! What if we did it the other way around?</p>
            <div class="quote"><blockquote><p>iron oxide + copper -> ... (no reaction)</p></blockquote></div>
            <p>There's no reaction at all! So what has happened?</p>
            <p>We can describe this behaviour as <b>displacement</b>. In short, metals can <em>displace</em> other metals from compounds (remove them and take their place), but only if the metal is more reactive than the one in the compound. Iron is more reactive than copper, and so it was able to displace copper from its oxide compound.</p>
            <p>There are specific terms we can use to refer to what happens to each element. In this case, iron has gained oxygen (it has become an oxide), and so we can say that it has been <b>oxidised</b>. The copper, by contrast, has lost oxygen (it has been removed from its oxide), and so we can say that it has been <b>reduced</b>. This reaction is called a <b>redox</b> reaction, as both reduction and oxidation have taken place. We can also call reduction the gaining of electrons and oxidation the losing of electrons, although this relates to ions and is beyond the scope of this topic.</p>
            <h4>Carbon Reduction and Extraction</h4>
            <p>You might notice that our reactivity series diagram has carbon on it. This isn't because carbon reacts in the same way as metals with acids and water - it doesn't. We often put carbon on the series so that we can compare it with metals, and this is important for carbon reduction.</p>
            <p>In order for metals to be useful, we have to extract them from their ores (their compounds such as oxides). There are a variety of ways to do this, but for metals which are less reactive than carbon, we can displace the metal with carbon. This is done at high temperatures in a <b>blast furnace</b>. For example, we can extract iron from its ore (iron oxide) as follows:</p>
            <div class="quote"><blockquote><p>iron oxide + carbon -> carbon dioxide + iron</p></blockquote></div>
            <p>As you can see, the carbon has removed the iron from its oxide, leaving carbon dioxide (which can be vented from the furnace) and pure iron.</p>
            <p>However, metals that are more reactive than carbon cannot be extracted using it. As a result, we must extract these differently, either with a more reactive metal or via electrolysis.</p>
            <p>Finally, gold, copper and silver are so unreactive that they often do not react with oxygen, and can be found in a raw metal state. In this case, extraction is not required at all.</p>
