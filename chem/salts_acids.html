            <h3>Revision Notes</h3>
            <p>We can produce salts by reacting certain elements and compounds with acid.</p>
            <h4>Salts from Metals</h4>
            <p>When a metal is added to an acid, a reaction <em>usually</em> takes place.</p>
            <p>As a general rule, the equation for this reaction is:</p>
            <div class="quote"><blockquote><p>acid + metal -> salt + hydrogen</p></blockquote></div>
            <p>As we know, a salt is formed when an acid and an alkali are formed, and therefore we can infer that metals are alkaline.</p>
            <p>The salt that is formed is dictated by the type of acid that is reacted, and <em>NOT</em> the metal. The three main acids we will look at are hydrochloric acid (<code>HCl</code>), nitric acid (<code>HNO<sub>3</sub></code>), and sulfuric acid (<code>H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub></code>). The resulting salts are as follows:</p>
            <div class="quote"><blockquote>
                <p>metal + hydrochloric acid -> metal chloride + hydrogen</p>
                <p>metal + nitric acid -> metal nitrate + hydrogen</p>
                <p>metal + sulfuric acid -> metal sulfate + hydrogen</p>
            </blockquote></div>
            <p>For example, if we reacted magnesium and hydrochloric acid, we would be left with some magnesium chloride (<code>MgCl</code>), and additionally hydrogen gas. We can check for this hydrogen gas using the lit splint-squeaky pop test.</p>
            <p>However, not all metals can react with acid. If we try to react copper with hydrochloric acid, nothing happens, and the lit splint-squeaky pop test does not work. This is because copper <b>is not reactive enough</b> to react with acids, and this also applies to elements less reactive than copper, such as gold and silver.</p>
            <h4>Salts from Bases</h4>
            <p>Another way of obtaining a salt is from bases/alkalis (remember that an alkali is a water-soluble base), such as metal hydroxides (which can be made using <a href="acids_alkalis.html">metals and water</a>, metal oxides (formed when metals react with oxygen) and metal carbonates (formed when metal oxides react with carbon dioxide). The results of these compounds reacting with acid are as follows:</p>
            <div class="quote"><blockquote><p>metal oxide + acid -> salt + water</p></blockquote></div>
            <div class="quote"><blockquote><p>metal hydroxide + acid -> salt + water</p></blockquote></div>
            <div class="quote"><blockquote><p>metal carbonate + acid -> salt + water + carbon dioxide</p></blockquote></div>
            <p>The rules for what salt is formed are the same as the ones for metal elements + acid (see "Salts from Metals"). For example, if we react sodium carbonate (<code>Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub></code>) with hydrochloric acid, we will be left with sodium chloride, water, and carbon dioxide.</p>
            <p>One key reason why being able to form salts from bases is so important is because it allows us to make salts out of otherwise unreactive elements. For example, copper sulfate <b>cannot be obtained from copper in element form, as it is not reactive enough.</b> However, if we react copper hydroxide with sulfuric acid, then we can obtain copper sulfate.</p>
            <h4>Ammonia and Acid</h4>
            <p>The reaction of acid with ammonia (<code>NH<sub>3</sub></code>) is another important one which you are required to know. When reacted with acid, ammonia produces an ammonium salt. As with metals, this salt depends on the acid used. The equation is as follows:</p>
            <div class="quote"><blockquote><p>ammonia + acid -> ammonium salt</p></blockquote></div>
            <p>For example, reacting ammonia with hydrochloric acid produces ammonium chloride (<code>NH<sub>4</sub>Cl</code>). Nothing else is produced in this reaction.</p>
            <h4>Practical Example: Making Salts</h4>
            <p>You need to know this practical as you will be tested on the method, etc. on the GCSE. We are going to demonstrate how you can prepare copper sulfate from copper oxide powder and dilute sulfuric acid, although for a different salt you can just change the metal and acid used.</p>

                <h4>WARNING!</h5>
                <p>There are dangers to this practical: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>You <b>MUST</b> wear eye protection if carrying out this practical.</p></li>
                    <li><p>This practical should be done in a lab in the presence of a science teacher, <b>NOT AT HOME.</b></p></li>
                    <li><p>While the sulfuric acid is dilute, it can still irritate the skin, so <b>wash your hands thoroughly if there is contact with skin.</b><b>Do not get any acid in your eyes.

                    <li><p>Copper oxide and copper sulfate can also be dangerous, so handle them with care and avoid getting any in your eyes, mouth or skin.</p></li>

                <h5>Equipment</h5>
                <p>This practical requires:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>25 cm<sup>3</sup> of dilute sulfuric acid.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Copper oxide powder</p></li>
                    <li><p>Bunsen burner</p></li>
                    <li><p>Chemical beaker</p></li>
                    <li><p>Filter paper</p></li>
                    <li><p>Evaporating basin</p></li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Method</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li><p>Heat the acid over the bunsen burner in the chemical beaker. <b>MAKE SURE THAT THE ACID DOES NOT BOIL!</b></p></li>
                    <li><p>Slowly add the copper oxide to the acid with stirring until the copper oxide stops dissolving into the acid. This indicates that all the acid has been used up.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Use filter paper to remove the excess copper oxide.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Evaporate the excess water from the remaining salt in an evaporating basin (optionally over a bunsen burner).</p></li>
                    <li><p>Leave the saturated salt solution to slowly form large crystals of salt.</p></li>

                    <p>Limewater turns cloudy when carbon dioxide is present. A reaction takes place where an unknown substance is reacted with hydrochloric acid. The limewater turns cloudy, and further tests indicate that magnesium chloride was left. What was the original substance? <br></p>

                        <p>If both carbon dioxide and a salt were produced, then the substance must be a metal carbonate. The salt contains magnesium, and so the substance is magnesium carbonate.</p>
