# Cognitio
Revision website for the UK GCSE curriculum.

## A note on cheating
The questions on these websites are not tests. The goal is not to see how good you are. The goal of Cognitio is to help you revise for upcoming tests and exams. An unintended side effect of the website's code is that the answers are visible on both Inspect Element and the source code, but inspecting these to find the answers will mean that you gain nothing. If you read this and still cheat, then you are forfeiting the effectiveness of this website.
