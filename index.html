            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Cognitio was made as a school project for the Duke of Edinburgh award. The website's purpose is to provide revision notes, quizzes and exam-style questions to students at the KS3 and GCSE level. I had the idea for the website when I was trying to revise for an upcoming test, and realised how little information there was online on certain topics, particularly quizzes and questions. Therefore, I made this website to try and provide some help. The content here is tailored to the United Kingdom KS3 and GCSE curriculum, although bear in mind that there is likely to be information that is missing or not to a GCSE level.</p>
