            <h3>Revision Notes</h3>
            <p>Since cells are incredibly small (most cells are only a few micrometers, one ten-thousandth of a centimetre, large), we need to use a <b>microscope</b> in order to observe them properly.</p>
            <p>A microscope has lots of complex parts and as such you must learn what they are and what they do:</p>
            <img class="intab" src="/images/bio/Microscope Diagram.png">
            <p>The <b>eyepiece lens(es)</b> is the part you look into and has a small magnification (usually 10x) in order to help you see the cells better.</p>
            <p>However, most of the magnification comes from the <b>objective lenses</b>, of which there are usually three. The magnifications of these are usually any three of 4x, 10x, 40x and 100x, and they can be interchanged when observing a cell. We use the smallest one first because it gives us a greater depth of field, and as such we can locate the cell before zooming into it.</p>
            <p>The <b>stage</b> is where the cells are placed for viewing with a slide. A <b>light</b> sits underneath to light up the cells and make them clearer. The position of the stage can be controlled with a knob.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the <b>focus controls</b>, of which there is a <b>coarse focus</b> and a <b>fine focus</b>. They both move the lens closer to the cells, but the coarse one moves faster. This allows you to quickly focus in with the coarse one and then obtain the exact desired focus with the fine one.</p>
            <h4>Equations</h4>
            <p>We can calculate the total magnification of the microscope with the equation:</p>
            <div class="quote">
                <blockquote>
                    <p>total magnification = eyepiece magnification x objective magnification</p>
                </blockquote>
            </div>
            <p>There is also an equation relating to the real size, magnification and image size of a specimen under a microscope. We can use two of these to find the third one, i.e. using the image size and magnification to find the real size of a cell. The equations are as follows:</p>
            <div class="quote">
                <blockquote>
                    <p>total magnification = image size / actual size</p>
                    <p>real size = image size / total magnification</p>
                    <p>image size = real size x total magnification</p>
                </blockquote>
            </div>
            <h4>Electron microscopes</h4>
            <p>In 1933, scientists discovered a new way to look at cells in even more detail - the electron microscope.</p>
            <p>This microscope fires electrons at the cell and then uses a camera to build up an image of the cell in incredible detail.</p>
            <p>Images taken with an electron microscope can have a much higher magnification and resolution (the amount of detail visible) and so they allow us to see very small things that we previously were unable to.</p>
            <p>The disadvantages of an electron microscope are that it cannot take colour images (as it is not using light) and it cannot be used to scan living cells (because it creates a vacuum when it takes images). They are also incredibly expensive and usually only found in universities and laboratories.</p>
