            <h3>Revision Notes</h3>
            <p>Substances need to move from cell to cell in order for your body to use them and, essentially, function at all.</p>
            <h4>Diffusion</h4>
            <p>Diffusion is the movement of molecules down a concentration gradient. This means that they go from an area where there is high concentration to an area where there is low concentration, and this continues until there is an equal concentration everywhere - when <b>equilibrium</b> is reached.</p>
            <img class="intab" src="/images/bio/Diffusion.png">
            <p>An example of this is in the stomata of a leaf, where carbon dioxide diffuses into the leaf because there is a higher concentration in the air, and oxygen diffuses out of the leaf because there is a higher concentration inside the leaf. Because the leaf uses CO2 constantly for respiration, equilibrium is never reached and the process continues.</p>
            <p>The same thing happens inside your lungs, in the alveoli - but oxygen diffuses into the blood stream and carbon dioxide out. This allows your cells to get oxygen, which they need to work!</p>
            <p>Diffusion is affected by several factors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Temperature: if the temperature is higher, then the particles have more kinetic energy and so they diffuse faster.</p></li>
                <li><p>Surface area to volume ratio (s.a. divided by volume): If this is higher, there is more area for diffusion to occur - so it happens faster.</p></li>
                <li><p>Distance: The shorter distance the particles have to travel, the greater the rate of diffusion.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Osmosis</h4>
            <p>Osmosis is the diffusion of water specifically, down a concentration gradient through a partially permeable membrane.</p>
            <p>Note that in a solution, osmosis occurs down a concentration gradient of water, not of the solute.</p>
            <p>Osmosis is important in cells, where the cells need water for their structure and function.</p>
            <p>If a cell has more water outside than inside, i.e. the solution inside is too concentrated, then the cell is <b>hypertonic</b> and it becomes plasmolysed (the cell collapses).</p>
            <p>If a cell has equal water inside it as outside, then it is <b>isotonic</b> and it is flaccid.</p>
            <p>If a cell has more water inside than outside, i.e. the solution is dilute, then is it <b>hypotonic</b>, and turgid (swollen).</p>
            <img class="intab" src="/images/bio/Osmosis.png">
            <p>In plant cells, turgidity is usually fine but in animal cells (i.e. blood cells), it can cause the cells to burst. This is why in a blood bank, blood is suspended in a special substance which keeps the blood cells isotonic.</p>
            <h4>Active Transport</h4>
            <p>Sometimes, we need to transfer a substance even if there is a low concentration of it.</p>
            <p>We can use active transport to move molecules up a concentration gradient (from an area of low concentration to one of high concentration).</p>
            <p>This is useful if we need lots of a substance.</p>
            <p>Unlike osmosis and diffusion, which are examples of <b>passive transport</b>, active transport requires energy.</p>
            <p>An example of active transport in the body is in the small intestine. If you have recently eaten a meal then your blood supply will have plenty of glucose, at a higher concentration than in the small intestine. However, the glucose in the small intestine is still needed for respiration, so active transport is used to absorb that glucose anyway.</p>
